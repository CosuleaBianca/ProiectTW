    "introduction":"The wizarding world is filled with memorable characters. Some, like Severus Snape, are complex and mysterious. Their stories span the decades, the whole saga and beyond. Others, like Mundungus Fletcher, manage to be interesting and complicated even though they only pop in and out of the story occasionally. There are witches and wizards, hags and giants, house-elves and Muggles, werewolves and vampires, good people and bad. Many of them have particularly appropriate names, like Remus Lupin the werewolf: Remus was one of the wolf-raised twins who legend tells us founded the city of Rome and Lupin comes from the Latin word for wolf. Alliterative names abound â€” Dudley Dursley, Peter Pettigrew. Family members and friends of the author turn up attached to bus drivers and Quidditch players. And even the names that have no deeper meaning roll off the tongue like delightful sweets: the name of Hambledon Quince comes to mind.",
