    "introduction":"The wizarding world is filled with memorable characters. Some, like Severus Snape, are complex and mysterious. Their stories span the decades, the whole saga and beyond. Others, like Mundungus Fletcher, manage to be interesting and complicated even though they only pop in and out of the story occasionally. There are witches and wizards, hags and giants, house-elves and Muggles, werewolves and vampires, good people and bad. Many of them have particularly appropriate names, like Remus Lupin the werewolf: Remus was one of the wolf-raised twins who legend tells us founded the city of Rome and Lupin comes from the Latin word for wolf. Alliterative names abound — Dudley Dursley, Peter Pettigrew. Family members and friends of the author turn up attached to bus drivers and Quidditch players. And even the names that have no deeper meaning roll off the tongue like delightful sweets: the name of Hambledon Quince comes to mind.",

He attempts to murder the boy, but instead kills his parents, Lily and James Potter, and leaves Harry with a scar on his forehead in the shape of a lightning bolt. Nearly every witch or wizard dares not utter his name and refers to him instead with such monikers as \"You-Know-Who\", \"He Who Must Not Be Named\", or \"the Dark Lord\". Voldemort's obsession with blood purity signifies his aim to rid the wizarding world of Muggle (non-magical) heritage and to conquer both worlds, Muggle and wizarding, to achieve pure-blood dominance. Through his mother's family, he is the last descendant of the wizard Salazar Slytherin, one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is the leader of the Death Eaters, a group of evil wizards and witches dedicated to ridding the Wizarding World of Muggles and establishing Voldemort as its supreme ruler.",
